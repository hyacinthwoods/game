# Trex Run Like Game
A basic obstacle jumping game where a bunny jumps over obstacles to evade a wolf. Due to my background in digital illustration and graphic design, I created all graphics for the game. 

Credits:
To acheive the basic functionality of my game, I used a tutorial from Keep Coding on youtube. https://youtu.be/i7nIutSLvdU?si=hxLMuXcaxPzCsMxN .
To create a score system I asked chatGPT. 
For the start screen and end game screen, a tutorial by David Ried on Youtube was helpful, https://youtu.be/FwLMz7jMRac?si=VSlIWe8LK-J-5Fss .
All of the assets and art were created by myself using Procreate for Ipad. 

Bugs:
-Bunny will sometimes detect collission even when it does not occur.
-Start screen and ending screen are not yet functional.

Goals:
-Score based on distance rather than how many obstacles jumped over.
-Speed increase based on score increments.
-Multiple obstacles that alternate periodically
-Start animation where bunny is running away from wolf.
-Snding animation where wolf catches bunny and screen turns red.
-Jumping and collision sound effects, music etc.
-Music toggle on home screen

More Advanced Goals:
-Multiple maps and locations, perhaps unlockable.

# trex run like game
A basic obstacle jumping game where a bunny jumps over obstacles to evade a wolf. To acheive the basic functionality of my game, I used a tutorial from Keep Coding on youtube. https://youtu.be/i7nIutSLvdU?si=hxLMuXcaxPzCsMxN .
To create a score system I used chatGPT. 
For the start screen and end game screen, a tutorial by David Ried on Youtube was helpful, https://youtu.be/FwLMz7jMRac?si=VSlIWe8LK-J-5Fss .

All of the assets and art were created by myself using Procreate for Ipad.
